Privacy Policy

Effective Date: March 14, 2024

This Privacy Policy outlines the practices of MCRAFT.FUN concerning the collection, usage, and protection of user data. By using MCRAFT.FUN, you consent to the terms described herein.

1. **Data Collection**:
   We do not collect, store, or share any kind of user statistics or personal data. Our application does not utilize any trackers or analytics tools.

2. **Data Processing (Google Drive Integration)**:
   All user data processing occurs solely on the client side within the application. We do not transmit any user data to external servers except for requests made to Google APIs for specific functionalities.

3. **Data Storage (Google Drive Integration)**:
   We do not store user API tokens. Our application accesses directories specified by the user, starting from the root directory up to the user-specified path, to retrieve necessary data for its functionalities. For example, if the user specifies "/worlds/", our application will read the contents of "/", then the contents of "/worlds/", and if "/worlds/" contains subdirectories such as "/a/", the application will further read the contents of "/worlds/a/level.dat". When a world is loaded, the application also reads contents of "/worlds/a/**", such as "/worlds/a/region/*.mca".

4. **Peer-to-Peer Connectivity**:
   We utilize the public PeerJS API to facilitate peer-to-peer connections among users. However, such connections are established only upon the user's explicit action, such as clicking on the "Open to WAN" button within the pause menu of the game.

5. **Third-Party Services**:
   Our application may integrate with third-party services, such as Google APIs, to provide specific functionalities. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of these third-party services for information on their data handling practices.

<!-- 6. **Security Measures**:
   We employ industry-standard security measures to safeguard user data against unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. These measures include encryption protocols, access controls, and adherence to best practices in data protection. -->

6. **Policy Updates**:
   We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy as necessary to reflect changes in our data handling practices or compliance requirements. Any such updates will be prominently displayed on our website: policy.mcraft.fun.

For inquiries or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or any other questions, please contact us at <support@mcraft.fun>.
